Given that not even NetBeans supports modifying the AST during compilation, as is possible by Javac, it's preferred to default to actually modifying the code and generate new code directly into the source file. That earns transparency, visibility, portability, and hopefully ease of implementation. The plan is to use the filer api (of apt) to get the current file and write to it. It be worthwhile to look more into the Java source, although that looks primarily targetted at changing the editor. So first try the filer, it's cheap.




1. Verify that all constructors are private, after having possibly privatized the default constructor.
2. initialize instance to the no-args constructor
3. make instance final and not private anymore (private only when not final, or the user explicited the instance)
4. change codebase to com.dp4j
5. superfually support all patterns (and @Documented)
6. support -Averbose=false option for javac users
7. Support lazy


DONE:
6. figure out if NB requires agent support -> it does
